# 🔥 Applications of Differentiation

## **3-Day Plan (MIT 18.01 Sessions 10–16)**

**CS50-Style · Theory First → Problems Later · Low Cognitive Load**

---

## 🟥 Day 1 — Shape, Extremes & Guarantees

**Mental mode:** *“What does the function do, and must it do it?”*

### Theory (MIT first — in this order)

* **Session 10 — Curve Sketching**

  * Increasing / decreasing
  * Concavity
  * Inflection points
* **Session 11 — Max–Min Problems**

  * Critical points
  * Global vs local extrema
* **Session 14 — Mean Value Theorem & Inequalities**

  * Existence guarantees
  * Average vs instantaneous change

### Why this grouping works

* Curve sketching → what is possible
* Max–min → where extremes occur
* MVT → why an extreme must exist

**Unified idea:** behavior + guarantees

### Problems (after all theory)

* *James Stewart*:

  * Curve sketching (no calculator first)
  * Absolute extrema problems
  * Mean Value Theorem reasoning problems

### 🎯 End-of-Day Test

> Given only derivative information, can I predict shape **and** justify existence of extrema?

## 🟧 Day 2 — Change Propagation & Numerical Thinking

**Mental mode:** *“How does change move through a system?”*

### Theory

* **Session 12 — Related Rates**

  * Chain rule as dependency tracking
  * Time-based change
* **Session 13 — Newton’s Method**

  * Iterative improvement
  * Convergence and failure

### Why together

* Related rates → exact change relationships
* Newton’s method → approximate change via iteration

**Same thinking, different precision**

### Problems

* *James Stewart*:

  * Related rate word problems (draw diagrams first)
  * Newton iteration problems
  * Analyze divergence / slow convergence

### 🎯 End-of-Day Test

> Can I explain *why* a quantity changes, not just compute its rate?

## 🟩 Day 3 — From Rates to Laws (Reverse Thinking)

**Mental mode:** *“Given how something changes, what is the system?”*

### Theory

* **Session 15 — Differentials & Antiderivatives**

  * Differentials as small physical changes
  * Reverse direction of differentiation
* **Session 16 — Differential Equations**

  * Separation of variables
  * Modeling laws of change

### Why together

* Differentials → local change
* Differential equations → global change law

**Natural inversion of earlier ideas**

### Problems

* *James Stewart*:

  * Differential approximation and error
  * Simple separable differential equations
  * Physical interpretation problems

### 🎯 End-of-Day Test

> Can I write a differential equation from a physical rule and solve it cleanly?
