# Applications of Differentiation  
**MIT 18.01 × James Stewart (Early Transcendentals)**  
**CS50-Style Problem-First Study Plan**

This repository documents my structured study of **Chapter 4: Applications of Differentiation** from  
*James Stewart – Early Transcendentals*, aligned with **MIT 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus)**.

The approach follows a **CS50-style methodology**:
- Concepts are treated like algorithms
- Emphasis is placed on problem-solving, reasoning, and debugging
- Theory is learned only to the extent needed to solve meaningful problems

---

## 📌 Study Philosophy

- Learn by **deriving**, not memorizing
- Treat calculus concepts as **logical systems**
- Focus on **why** methods work, not just how
- Prefer **hand analysis first**, technology only for verification
- Model real-world problems before applying calculus tools

## 📅 4-Day Deep-Dive Structure

### 🔴 Day 1 — Logic & Guarantees
**Sections Covered**
- 4.1 Maximum and Minimum Values
- 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem

**Focus**
- Critical points and endpoints
- Absolute vs local extrema
- Mean Value Theorem as an existence guarantee

**Goal**
> Be able to prove when a function must attain a maximum or minimum using only assumptions (continuity and differentiability).

---

### 🟠 Day 2 — Shape & Visualization
**Sections Covered**
- 4.3 What Derivatives Tell Us About the Shape of a Graph
- 4.5 Summary of Curve Sketching
- 4.6 Graphing with Calculus and Technology

**Focus**
- First derivative → monotonicity
- Second derivative → concavity
- Inflection points and asymptotic behavior

**Goal**
> Sketch a function accurately using only derivative information, without plotting points.

---

### 🟡 Day 3 — Optimization (Modeling Reality)
**Sections Covered**
- 4.7 Optimization Problems
- Applied Projects:
  - The Shape of a Can
  - Planes and Birds: Minimizing Energy

**Focus**
- Translating word problems into mathematical models
- Objective functions and constraints
- Validating solutions using physical and dimensional reasoning

**Goal**
> Solve real-world optimization problems and justify why the solution makes sense beyond calculus.

---

### 🟢 Day 4 — Failure, Approximation & Reversal
**Sections Covered**
- 4.4 Indeterminate Forms and l’Hospital’s Rule
- 4.8 Newton’s Method
- 4.9 Antiderivatives
- Review & Problems Plus

**Focus**
- Handling indeterminate limits
- Iterative numerical root-finding
- Reconstructing functions from derivatives

**Goal**
> Understand how calculus handles failure cases and why numerical methods are essential in computation.

## 🛠️ Problem-Solving Method (CS50 Style)

Before solving any problem:
1. Identify what is **given**
2. Identify what must be **found**
3. Write a **plan** (pseudocode-style)
4. Solve symbolically
5. Verify the result (units, reasonableness, graph if needed)

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Paper & pen (primary)
- Desmos / Graphing Calculator (verification only)
- MIT 18.01 lecture notes (concept alignment)
- James Stewart textbook (problem source)

---

## 🎯 Mastery Criteria

This chapter is considered mastered when I can:
- Explain derivative-based reasoning verbally
- Sketch graphs from derivative data alone
- Model and solve optimization problems independently
- Apply numerical methods and recognize their limitations
