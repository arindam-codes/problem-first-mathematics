# problem-first-mathematics
A problem-first, CS50-style journey through mathematics — learning concepts by breaking them, rebuilding them, and applying them like algorithms. This repository documents my attempt to understand mathematics from first principles through rigorous problem solving, intuition building, and real-world modeling rather than memorization.
