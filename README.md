# Self-Study in Mathematics, Computing & Engineering  
**MIT-Style • Problem-First • Concept-Driven**

This repository documents my long-term, structured self-study in **mathematics, computing, and engineering**, guided primarily by **MIT OpenCourseWare** and standard university textbooks.

The focus is not on certificates or course completion, but on **deep conceptual understanding**, rigorous problem-solving, and the ability to apply theory to real systems.

## 🎯 Study Philosophy

My approach is inspired by:
- MIT’s emphasis on fundamentals
- CS50’s problem-first methodology
- The Feynman technique of learning through explanation

Key principles:
- Learn concepts as **systems**, not formulas
- Treat mathematics like **logic and algorithms**
- Prefer derivations over memorization
- Use computation and visualization only to **verify reasoning**
- Build intuition strong enough to work without tools

## 🧠 How This Repository Is Organized

Each folder corresponds to a **topic, course, or textbook chapter**, typically including:
- A focused `README.md` describing the learning goal
- Problem-solving notes and derivations
- Conceptual explanations written in my own words
- Occasional applied or mini-projects

The structure evolves as understanding deepens.

## 📚 Primary References

- **MIT OpenCourseWare**
  - 18.01 — Single Variable Calculus
  - 18.02 — Multivariable Calculus
  - 6.xx — Computer Science & Systems
- Standard textbooks (e.g., James Stewart, Spivak, Strang)
- Original problem sets and self-designed exercises

---

## 🛠 Tools & Workflow

- Paper-first problem solving
- LaTeX / Markdown for documentation
- Programming used only when it adds insight
- Version control used as a learning log, not just storage

---

## 📈 Goal

To build a foundation strong enough to:
- Reason independently about mathematical systems
- Apply mathematics to computing, engineering, and modeling
- Transition smoothly into advanced topics such as:
  - Algorithms
  - Numerical methods
  - Machine learning
  - Quantitative modeling

## ⚠️ Notes

This repository reflects an **active learning process**.  
Expect incomplete sections, revisions, and evolving explanations as understanding improves.

Accuracy and clarity take priority over polish.
